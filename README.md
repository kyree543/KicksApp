## Notes and Comments

Describe any challenges. a couple challenges i had was getting gemeni to put seperate pictures in the categorys of the shoes and clothes i had to constantly keep telling it where it had to be and what type of pictures had to be there.
another challenge was making the app it was kind of hard at first but i got the hang of it  and created a good looking app so far.
